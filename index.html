										<h2 style="text-align: center">Caterpillar Bangalore, India - Software Development Intern (March 2023 - July 2023)</h2>
										<p>During my internship at Caterpillar, Bangalore, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in cutting-edge software development projects, focusing on areas crucial to the company's technological advancement. My primary responsibilities centered around leveraging deep learning techniques to enhance object detection capabilities.</p>
										<p>One of the key projects I undertook involved the implementation of object detection using the YOLOv3 model, coupled with rigorous testing against the COCO dataset to achieve an impressive accuracy rate of 95%. This endeavor not only showcased my proficiency in working with advanced neural network architectures but also underscored my commitment to delivering results at the highest standards.</p>
										<p>In addition to YOLOv3, I actively contributed to benchmarking the Frames Per Second (FPS) for real-time models, specifically Yolact and RTMDet. Through meticulous testing and optimization, I observed a notable enhancement of 10% in the FPS, signifying my dedication to performance improvement and efficiency in real-world applications.</p>
										<p>Recognizing the importance of comprehensive validation, I took the initiative to implement Voxel FiftyOne as a Proof of Concept (POC) for visualizing true and false positives. This visualization tool significantly augmented our understanding of model performance by providing insights that led to a 30% improvement in comprehension. This initiative not only demonstrated my proactive problem-solving skills but also highlighted my ability to integrate innovative solutions for practical use.</p>
										<p>Moreover, my collaborative efforts within the team fostered an environment of knowledge exchange, contributing to a holistic learning experience. Engaging with cross-functional teams allowed me to gain insights into Caterpillar's diverse projects and broadened my understanding of how my contributions fit into the larger technological landscape.</p>
										<p>The experience at Caterpillar not only honed my technical skills but also instilled in me a deep appreciation for the collaborative and innovative culture that defines the company. The exposure to real-world challenges and the opportunity to work on impactful projects have undoubtedly been instrumental in shaping my perspective as a software development professional.</p>

										<h2 style="text-align: center">EvoluteIQ Bangalore, India - Software Engineering Intern (September 2022 - November 2022)</h2>
										<p>In my previous internship at EvoluteIQ, I played a pivotal role in advancing the company's automation capabilities, specifically focusing on the optimization of data collection processes and the streamlining of machine learning model creation.</p>
										<p>One of my major accomplishments was the automation of data collection, where I successfully implemented a RESTful API in Flask to collect up to 20 parameters from clients. This automation not only significantly reduced the time required for data collection but also contributed to a more streamlined and efficient production pipeline.</p>
										<p>Furthermore, I actively contributed to the automation of machine learning model creation, which resulted in a commendable 10% increase in the company's rate of jobs completed. This achievement underscored my ability to bridge the gap between software engineering and machine learning, showcasing my versatility in addressing multifaceted challenges.</p>
										<p>The experience at EvoluteIQ provided me with valuable insights into the synergy between software engineering and machine learning, complementing my skill set and broadening my understanding of how these domains intersect to drive innovation. The exposure to automation and optimization strategies in a professional setting has undoubtedly enhanced my proficiency in delivering impactful solutions.</p>
